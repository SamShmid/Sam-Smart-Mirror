# Ball Tracking Robot
I am working on a ball tracking robot that uses Arduino and Raspberry Pi to follow an object.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone includes the assembling of the chassis and attaching Mecanum wheels, but is otherwise mostly composed of software additions. The Mecanum wheels allow the robot to move in any direction without having to turn, and in the case that it does turn, there will be reduced friction due to the rollers on the wheels.

Then I studied electrical components and became familiar with Arduino’s, ESP32’s, and Raspberry Pi’s. I learned how to use advanced components such as ultrasonic sensors, infrared receivers, and stepper motors and motor drivers. I also created a program that used both of the ESP32’s cores simultaneously through multithreading. The Raspberry Pi’s software additions include a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), Virtual Network Computing (VNC), and a Github repository.

The SSH allows me to easily access my Raspberry Pi’s terminal from my laptop, and without a monitor for the Raspberry Pi. The VNC enables me to have full control over my Raspberry Pi’s screen from my laptop, meaning I can use my laptop and Raspberry Pi from one computer. Finally, I set up a Github repository in order to transfer files and code from Visual Studio Code, my main code editor, on my laptop to the one on my Raspberry Pi. I also learned all the necessary Git commands to allow me to do this.
