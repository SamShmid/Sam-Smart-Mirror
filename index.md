# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my Raspberri Pi and the Magic Mirror2 software. I installed the Raspberry Pi OS on a sd card than inserted it into my Raspberry Pi. After setting up the software I enabled SSH and VNC in order to be able to connect to the Raspberry Pi with my computer. I installed the Magic Mirror2 software, but I intially ran into problems starting up the software until i realzied you have to change directories to do so. After getting that working I installed modules, and I was doing so I ran into problems in the config file because there were errors in my code. Than with the help of my instructor we went through the code and found a missing "}" to be the culprit. After this everything was smooth sailing and I was able to configure the software without issue.
